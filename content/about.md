# About - Naresh Ganesan

I'm a **founder, builder, and applied AI architect** focused on turning ambitious ideas into **reliable, production-grade AI systems**.

Over the years, I've built and shipped AI-driven platforms across startups and large organizations—often in environments where **there was no room for experimentation theater**. Systems had to work, scale, and justify their cost from day one.

I've bootstrapped products to profitability without marketing teams or sales funnels, worked as a founding engineer at multiple startups, and led the design and delivery of AI systems that moved from whiteboard to real users. That mix—**ownership, execution, and pragmatism**—shapes how I approach everything I build today.

---

## What I Do Today

I spend my time across three closely related tracks:

### Building AI-first products

I'm actively building and experimenting with AI-native products centered around:

* Intelligent search and knowledge systems
* Agent-driven workflows for complex business processes
* Developer-facing AI infrastructure and tooling
* Cost-aware, observable LLM systems designed for real usage

I'm intentionally selective about what I disclose publicly until products reach meaningful traction. What I *can* say is that everything I build is grounded in **problems I've already seen in production**, not hypothetical use cases.

---

### Advising teams adopting AI (hands-on, not slideware)

I work with founders, CTOs, and product leaders who want to move beyond demos and:

* Ship their **first real AI system**
* Redesign existing products around **LLMs, search, or agents**
* Bring order to systems that are already showing signs of prompt sprawl, cost overruns, or brittle behavior

My role is often part architect, part sparring partner—helping teams decide **what to build, what not to build, and how to avoid expensive mistakes early**.

---

### Writing and thinking in public

InsightStream is where I document:

* Experiments I run while building products
* Architecture trade-offs in real AI systems
* Lessons learned from shipping search, agent, and workflow-heavy platforms
* Opinions shaped by systems that broke under real load—not just theory

Most posts here are opinionated, practical, and written for builders who care about outcomes.

---

## How I Think About AI Systems

A few principles consistently guide my work:

* **AI is a system, not a model**
  Models change fast. Architecture, workflows, and contracts endure.

* **Determinism matters more than cleverness**
  Especially when AI systems become part of critical business flows.

* **Production constraints should shape design early**
  Cost, latency, observability, and failure modes are not “later problems.”

* **Agents should orchestrate systems—not hide logic inside prompts**
  Control flow belongs in code; intelligence belongs in models.

---

## A Bit of Context

I've led and built systems across:

* Generative AI, LLMs, RAG, and agent-based architectures
* Search platforms built from scratch and taken to production
* Code generation and automation systems used by engineers, not just demos
* Distributed, event-driven platforms where reliability and scale mattered

In many of these roles, I wasn't just designing systems—I was accountable for **making them work in the real world**.

---

## Why This Site Exists

InsightStream is not a portfolio and not a marketing funnel.

It's a place to:

* Capture how my thinking evolves while building
* Share patterns that consistently work (and those that don't)
* Create a public trail behind the products and systems I'm building today

Over time, this site will also become the place where I openly share more about those products—once they've earned it.

## If You're Reading This…

You're probably here because you're:

* Building an AI-powered product and want a second brain
* Leading a team navigating LLMs, search, or agents in production
* Looking for a collaborator who's built systems end-to-end, not just prototypes

If that's the case, I'm always open to thoughtful conversations. If you’d like to connect, you can find me here:
