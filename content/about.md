## About Me

I began my career like many engineers: building systems, shipping features, and chasing the excitement of new technology. But somewhere around 2017, when I started working with applied AI, something clicked. I realised that AI was not just another layer in the tech stack, it was a new way for businesses to work, for people to make decisions, and for products to create value.
<br><br>
Since then, I have spent years building AI systems across startups and larger companies. I have worked on 0-to-1 products that barely had a spec, on 1-to-100 scale-up phases where reliability and customer experience mattered the most, and in enterprise environments where AI had to integrate with complex workflows and legacy systems. Along the way, I have led initiatives in AI agents, RAG platforms, knowledge systems, and multimodal search, always with the focus on turning cutting-edge ideas into something customers actually use.
<br><br>
Over time, I realised that building great AI systems is not just about the models or the infrastructure. It is about understanding why customers need them, how they think, and where AI genuinely creates value. That curiosity is what drives me today. I am intentionally moving closer to customers, not farther from the code, so I can learn how AI is actually adopted, resisted, integrated, and measured in real organisations.
<br><br>
This blog is a part of that journey, a place where I write about engineering, applied AI, and the lessons I am collecting as I work toward eventually building my own AI-native company grounded firmly in real demand, not just technological possibility.
